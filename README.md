# HackRice
Mental health draws attention these days. As internet penetrates into our daily life, the negative contents on the website hugely impact on our moods and then our attitude towards the world and life imperceptibly. Especially to children who have little ability to tell what is correct and what is a twisted outlook towards life. However, it is almost impossible for parents to keep an eye on children all the time or protect them from extreme behavior and negative words from misanthropes. Therefore, we want to develop something to provide help information when the user is at the edge of desperation and prevent children and teenagers from negative information.

## Function
Because of the purpose, we chose to develop a Chrome plugin naturally. When enabled, the plugin will replace some extreme words, notify how negative the contents, provide contacts to professional help and offer a way for temporary relaxation. For parents, we set a lock to ensure the parents have supervision and control on what their children read, and record the history of negative websites and their degree.

We chose the owl as our icon based on several reason.
1.	The owl is the mascot of Rice.
2.	The owl has a keen sight and can be represented as supervision
3.	In the novel Harry Potter, the owls are pets of wizards. They have the ability to understand the feelings and the languages of human being.
